# Dynamic User Profiling

To enable effective human-agent interaction, dialogue agents must track shifts in user interests and provide tailored responses to maintain their engagement. 

## Motivation 
Building a dynamic user profiling system powered by a lightweight SLM (Small Language Model) and real-time shopping data.

### The key insight?
User interests shift constantly. Our goal is to model these shifting interests in real-time through a dynamic, graph-based profile that updates as the user continues to search and explore new items.

Hence the name: Dynamic User Profiling.
